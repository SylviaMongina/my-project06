# Set Up
- [x] Clone the repository using 'https://github.com/SylviaMongina/my-project06.git' or download and extract the zip file.
- [x] Open up the cloned folder in your preferred text editor. Open up a terminal within your workspace and navigate into the my-project06
- [x] Within that folder, run `npm install` which will install all dependencies for you then run `npm run server` to run the json-server for your backend.
- [x] Finally open a new terminal while keeping base URL for your backend running on `http://localhost:3000/mainData` then run `npm start` and if prompted click y or yes thereafter you should get the default react-app running on http://localhost:300 :boom:


## Technologies Used
   * [HTML](https://html.com/)
   * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
   * [Visual Studio ](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   * [CSS](http://css.com/)
   * JavaScript
   * Use of local API server was implemented by creation of a json file,that is db.json that contains all the data items to be rendered by the React App.
   * The data from the json file is then fetched using the fetch keyword in JavaScript and converted to useable data before being rendered to the DOM. While fetching the data a GET request is performed on the local API and a response is delivered hence data from our json file is successfully renered in the DOM.
   * The web application also features use of React useStates,UseEffect hooks as well as react Routers to render the cart page, as well as toggling between items using the drop down filter.
